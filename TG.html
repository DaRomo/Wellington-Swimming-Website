<br>
<center><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2" color="000000"><p>The following guidelines are to inform parents and swimmers of the coach’s policies regarding practice. These policies have been developed over many years and are designed to provide the best possible practice environment for all.</p></font></center>
<br>
<font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2" color="000000"><p>1. It is essential for swimmers to attend as many practices as possible. If the swimmer misses practices on a regular basis, he/she falls behind their training regiment and progress is stalled. It is also discouraging to your fellow teammates, when a swimmer is inconsistent to practices. As swimmers we rely on each other being at practice each day, so that we have someone to train and compete with. The club does, however, encourage younger swimmers to participate in other activities in addition to swimming.
<br>
<br>
2. Swimmers are asked to arrive at least 10 minutes early for practice. This will give the swimmer ample time to gather their equipment, use the restroom, etc. Swimmers should be ready to swim five minutes prior to the start of their practice. 
<br>
<br>
3. Swimmers are expected to stay for the entire practice. Some of the most import sets come at the end of practice. It is also very discouraging to the swimmers who are in the water working hard. Swimming is very psychological, so when a training group is broken, the entire practice is broken up. It can also be a distraction to the group. In the event that the swimmer needs to be dismissed early from practice, coaches would like to be notified in advance.
<br>
<br>
4. Swimmers should have goggles and caps in good working order. Nothing is more frustrating for a coach than to see the same swimmer always fixing his/her goggles all the time. This affects training. 
<br>
<br>
5. Bad weather conditions, all swimmers are to call the pool and ask if there is practice. Swimmers must speak with a coach not a lifeguard. If swimmers are pulled out of practice because of lightning, they must first check with their coach before leaving. Many times the team will continue its practice indoors or it will use the time to have a team meeting. Inclement weather does not mean that there is no practice!
<br>
<br>
6. Every swimmer needs to respect and obey all pool rules. Any damage or vandalism of the facility may result in financial liability of the swimmers parents. This may also lead to the swimmer being asked to leave the team. 
<br>
<br>
7. Swimmers should know their best times for their events. It may be helpful to keep a chart for each year on the wall or in the computer. 
<br>
<br>
8. Swimmers should know their training schedule. This includes dry-land practices, so that the appropriate equipment is brought. 
<br>
<br>
9. Swimmers should be on their best behavior at all times to represent Wellington Swim Team in an exemplary fashion.</p>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<p>1. Ensure your child attends practice regularly and on time. 
<br>
<br>
2. Provide support and encouragement for your child especially when he/she hits a performance plateau or downturn. 
<br>
<br>
3. Get involved with the Team. Our parents are our greatest resource and we rely on their commitment and creativity to operate at a high standard. 
<br>
<br>
4. Participate in all fundraising activities. 
<br>
<br>
5. When the Team hosts a swim meet, parents will be asked to work at it. 
<br>
<br>
6. Parents are encouraged to move up the officiating ladder.</p>
<br>

<p>1. All swimmers will be subject to the same rules. 
<br>
<br>
2. It is the responsibility of the Head Coach to know and approve all coaches' training/teaching methods and pool discipline and to back his/her staff. 
<br>
<br>
3. It is the responsibility of each coach to set out specific rules pertaining to his/her group and teaching methods and attendance policy. Conduct and discipline during workouts are primarily matters between coach and swimmer. All the rules and regulations must be mutually understood and it is the swimmer's responsibility to act accordingly. 
<br>
<br>
4. Parents must be informed of their child's continued misconduct during workouts. They shall be informed promptly if their child has been asked to leave a workout, the reasons for this action and the conditions which must be met for his/her return.

<br>
5. The use of drugs and/or alcohol by TEAM swimmers is prohibited during Team activities. 
<br>
<br>
6. Chaperons will be appointed to attend "away" meets and Team functions when necessary. 
<br>
<br>
7. During "away" meets, swimmers must be responsible and accountable for their behavior to coaches and chaperons from departure from and arrival back in Wellington and chaperons will ensure that swimmers conform to all rules at the pool and elsewhere. All participants agree to these rules by signing the Code of Conduct before departing from Wellington. 
<br>
<br>
8. At "away" meets, coaches and chaperons will establish and enforce reasonable curfew times for each age group. 
<br>
<br>
9. Chaperons will have full authority off deck for both male and female swimmers, including the authority to send a swimmer home during a meet at his/her parent's expense. Such action will only be taken in consultation with the coach and other chaperons and after the parents have been notified. 
<br>
<br>
10.The team will reimburse chaperons who assume on-the-spot payment for damage caused by a swimmer. The cost will be recovered from the swimmer and his/her family. 
<br>
<br>
11. In the event of property damage or gross misconduct reflecting adversely on Wellington Swim Team public image, the parents of the offending swimmer(s) will be called before a standing committee to account for their child's behavior. The swimmer(s) may also attend the meeting. This committee will be appointed by the Coaches and Wellington Swim Team Parent Organization and will take disciplinary action. 
<br>
<br>
12. All unresolved grievances and complaints will be submitted in writing to the Head Coach who has the responsibility to arrange meetings with those involved, to hear all sides and to make a decision about how to resolve the differences.</p>

<br>
<center><b><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="0000FF" size="6">Code of Conduct</font></b></center>
<br>
<center><p>Swimmers, coaches, chaperons and parents traveling with the Wellington Swim Team represent themselves, the Team, the sport of swimming and their community when they travel to swim meets/events. Wellington Swim Team wants to project an image that makes all of us proud of our sport and our swimmers. Therefore, all individuals representing or traveling on behalf of the Wellington Swim Team will abide by the following Code of Conduct. This Code is in effect from the point of departure until returning home. Anyone signing the Code of Conduct agrees that he/she will abide by it while representing the Wellington Swim Team.</p></center> 
<br>
<center>Infractions of the Code of Conduct may result in that swimmer's family having to assume the full cost of the trip plus return fare if the swimmer is sent home early.</center> 
<br>
<br>
1. Swimmers will not be allowed to drink or carry alcoholic beverages or use drugs other than those prescribed by a physician. Such drugs must be reported to the coaching and/or managerial staff. However, proper administration of prescribed drugs will be the swimmer's responsibility. 
<br>
<br>
2. No swimmer is permitted to smoke or chew tobacco. 
<br>
<br>
3. Appropriate behavior is mandatory on team trips. When behavior is deemed unacceptable by the coaches or chaperons or accompanying staff, that swimmer will be scratched from the competition and sent home at his/her own expense. In extreme cases, outright dismissal from the team will result. Examples of inappropriate behavior include
<br>
<br>
- failure to comply with stated rules and/or curfews as set out by the coaches and chaperons. 
<br>
- any behavior in violation of a criminal code. 
<br>
<br>
4. Responsible, orderly and reasonably quiet behavior is expected of swimmers at all times, including: 
<br>
- while traveling on rented or public transportation. 
<br>
- when on the pool deck, in restaurants and all other public areas. 
<br>
<br>
5. Hotel etiquette of the highest caliber is mandatory. Because hotels are resting places for all guests, the following behavior is not acceptable: 
<br>
- running up and down hallways. 
<br>
- constant room-to-room telephoning. 
<br>
- playing loud music or television. 
<br>
- fist fights and any kind of roughhousing. 
<br>
- prank phone calls to anyone in the hotel. 
<br>
- pranks of any nature which may result in damage to property or injury to fellow teammates. 
<br>
<br>
6. Male and female swimmers must at no time be in each other's rooms with the doors closed. Whenever a member of the opposite sex is in your hotel room, the door must be propped open. 
<br>
<br>
7. Athletes from other teams are not allowed in swimmers' hotel rooms, unless explicit approval has been given by the supervisory staff (coach and/or chaperon). 
<br>
<br>
8. All team members are expected to respect each individual's needs for rest and study times which will vary from trip to trip. 
<br>
<br>
9. Curfews, as determined by the staff, are set to ascertain proper rest for all swimmers. These must be adhered to at all times. Failure to comply may result in that swimmer's being scratched form competitions or in more severe cases sent home at his/her own expense. 
<br>
<br>
10. When being billeted, athletes must be on their best behavior at all times. Conditions will not always be ideal, but unreasonable behavior will not be tolerated. 
<br>
<br>
11. Swimmers should consider that it is their responsibility to report behavior that does not adhere to the Code of Conduct to the coaches or chaperons. 
<br>
<br>
12. All of the above conditions also apply to the last night of any trip. There may be occasions when the entire team will enjoy an outing, a movie or dinner on the last night. Return to the hotel must be orderly and quiet. All rules/curfews set out by the coaches and chaperons will be followed. 
<br>
<br>
13. For swimmers of legal drinking age, the Club recognizes that the conditions described above may infringe on some of your legal rights and may limit the freedom you usually enjoy. However, for the sake of unity within the team, your cooperation is required and expected. 
<br>
<br>
14. Any swimmer who does not agree with all the conditions listed above, may elect not to participate on this or any other trip. A simple refusal to turn in the signed agreement attached will be sufficient to indicate your desire to be excluded. 
<br>
<br>
15. Infractions will be dealt with on an individual basis and action may be taken immediately or after return to Wellington. The penalties may include immediate return home at the swimmer's expense or for Club-supported travel a reimbursement of the Club by the swimmer.
